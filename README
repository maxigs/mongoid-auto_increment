Adds an auto-increment field '_i' (underscore as internal field, like '_id', and i as commonly used loop-counter and because its short) to any Mongoid model by simply including the Module like you would with any other Mongoid-feature:

in some_model.rb

    require 'mongoid/auto_increment'
    class SomeModel
      include Mongoid::Document
      include Mongoid::AutoIncrement
      ...
    end

will create a field '_i' and automatically increment it for new inserts. The field can be accessed like any other field through mongoid (instance._i).

Adds an auto-increment field ('incr') to any Mongoid model by simply including the Module like you would with any other Mongoid-feature:

in some_model.rb

    require 'mongoid/auto_increment'
    class SomeModel
      include Mongoid::Document
      include Mongoid::AutoIncrement
      ...
    end

will create a field 'incr' and automatically increment it for new inserts.
